# Face-Recognition-Via-FaceNet
Using TF Keras to build a face recognition using architecture from FaceNet

**Note: `keras-facenet-h5` and the `variables` folder in `keras-facenet_tf23` could not be uploaded to GitHub**

## Objectives
* Differentiate between face recognition and face verification
* Implement one-shot learning to solve a face recognition problem
* Apply the triplet loss function to learn a network's parameters in the context of face recognition
* Explain how to pose face recognition as a binary classification problem
* Map face images into 128-dimensional encodings using a pretrained model
* Perform face verification and face recognition with these encodings
